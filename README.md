# Animal-crossing-api-qa-project

Welcome to my first official java project, and my first important edition to my GitHub portfolio. This software project was a graded assessment from a coding bootcamp, QA Academy, where I was tasked with creating a functional ‘back-end’ API of my choice that both holds lists of data within a database and is capable of handling Http requests from tools such as Postman.

I decided to create an API that held all of the Animal Crossing characters and their respective attributes, since it’s a game that many including me enjoy playing, and the information about each character is so fun to learn when they join yours or a friends’ island. I wanted to create something that would amplify that excitement.

**How did I expect the challenge to go?**

I expected the challenge to be a lot rougher on me than it was, but I think my own personal preparation shielded me from crashing and burning – I created 3 demo Spring Boot projects, each based on different situations, to ingrain the reason behind different methodologies into my head so I truly understood the concepts behind the code, and I took from countless academic books, video tutorials and online web resources to gain as much surrounding knowledge as possible.

This preparation helped me with more than just this project, but it also added to my troubleshooting and researching skills as I was determined to figure out as much as I could by myself. 

**What went well?**

The writing of the code itself went well, including the testing, which was pleasantly surprising considering before this project, it was the section of java that gave me the most hassle. I think that this project forced my brain to understand how to write tests, as I didn’t have much choice. Researching about testing itself proved to be more of a struggle than researching about writing any other parts of code, so it really made me sit and stare at the screen until I had debugged it all myself. That aspect taught me a lot.

**What didn’t go as planned?**

I thought that pushing to GitHub would be one of the simplest parts of this project, as would most people, but it really gave me the most trouble out of everything. I struggled to even connect my local and remote repositories because of unrelated histories and failing mergers that didn’t make an ounce of sense to me. Again however, I prevailed, after turning the web inside out and eventually asking for help.

**Possible improvements for future revisions of the project?**

I want to work on making my code adhere to the SOLID principles as much as possible next time. I tried to this time around too, however each moment I get better at programming, I will become better at implementing those principles and keeping my code as neat as possible.

I also want to look more into customisation of my project. This project only scraped the surface with the amount of customisation I applied – I want to add more custom exceptions next time, as well as adding more functionalities to the whole API to make it more interactive and interesting.

**Details of the process**

I used the Postman tool as my way of connecting to the local host and testing the addition and persistence of my API information. It was a really helpful way of making sure that my HTTP responses were correct, as well as checking my exceptions were being thrown in the background. Here are some screenshots of my testing CRUD functionality.

I also used Postman to test my custom queries. Here are a few examples of those working.

I also have screenshots of two open-source database engines I used to ensure the persistence and layout of my data was correct across more than one piece of software, in both testing environments and production environments.

I approached this project with a TDD process, using the Junit tetsing framework for integration testing throughout my project. Here are some screenshots showcasing my tests passing and the testing coverage I achieved in my project.

Thank you for reading about the insights and processes of my project. I hope you enjoy all that you see.
